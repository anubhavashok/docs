## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an API key">
    First create an API key using the instructions in [API keys](/installation/api-key)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the client">
    Next install the AskVideos client if using [Python](/installation/python). Or consult the [REST API](/installation/rest-api) reference for other frameworks.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an index">
    Next, [create an index](/quickstart/create-index). For this tutorial, we will use an index with the name 'test_index'
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add some videos">
    Next, [add some videos](/quickstart/add-videos) to the index. Now we are ready to get started with getting answers!
  </Step>

## Answer a question
```python
index_name = 'test_index'
query = 'What dog breeds are mentioned?'

results = client.answer(
            index_name,
            query)
```

The returned results look like this:
```json
{
    "6689571-hd_1280_720_25fps": [
        {
            "score": 0.09953739908006456,
            "start_seconds": 0,
            "end_seconds": 18
        }
    ],
    "855386-hd_1280_720_25fps": [
        {
            "score": 0.10187351703643799,
            "start_seconds": 0,
            "end_seconds": 2
        },
        {
            "score": 0.08336693048477173,
            "start_seconds": 2,
            "end_seconds": 6
        },
        {
            "score": 0.10038037598133087,
            "start_seconds": 6,
            "end_seconds": 10
        }
    ]
    ...
}
```


## Search using an images
```python
index_name = 'test_index'
image_path = '/path/to/image.jpg'
top_k = 30 # Number of results to return.

results = client.search_by_image(
            image_path,
            query,
            top_k=top_k)
```

## Search using a video
```python
index_name = 'test_index'
video_path = '/path/to/video.mp4'
top_k = 30 # Number of results to return.

results = client.search_by_video(
            index_name,
            video_path,
            top_k=top_k)
```
