<Note>Try out the answer function on a sample index in the [Answer playground](https://app.askvideos.com/playground)</Note>

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an API key">
    First create an API key using the instructions in [API keys](/installation/api-key)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the client">
    Next install the AskVideos client if using [Python](/installation/python). Or consult the [REST API](/api-reference/introduction) reference for other frameworks.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an index">
    Next, [create an index](/quickstart/add-videos#creating-an-index). For this tutorial, we will use an index with the name 'test_index'
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add some videos">
    Next, [add some videos](/quickstart/add-videos) to the index. Now we are ready to get started with getting answers!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Answer a question
```python
index_name = 'test_index'
query = 'What dog breeds are mentioned?'

results = client.answer(
            index_name,
            query)
```


## Answer modes

### Specific videos
Instead of using all the videos in the index, you can also specify the video_ids variable to limit the videos used in synthesizing the answer.

```python
video_ids = ['video_id1', 'video_id2', 'video_id3']

results = client.answer(
            index_name,
            query,
            video_ids=video_ids)
```

### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
AskVideos also supports RAG to synthesize answers from the video.

Using embeddings to find the relevant parts of the video before generating tokens helps to reduce cost and provide more accurate answers. In addition, if the text in the index exceeds the input token limit, RAG can help overcome this limitation by selecting only the most relevant parts for the context.

In order to specify RAG mode, simply update the mode variable as follows.

```python
results = client.answer(
            index_name,
            query,
            mode='rag')
```

If you need to limit the videos to perform RAG over, you can also specify the video_ids variable as follows.

```python
video_ids = ['video_id1', 'video_id2', 'video_id3']

results = client.answer(
            index_name,
            query,
            mode='rag',
            video_ids=video_ids)
```



## System prompt
The system prompt is customizable and can unlock powerful capabilities in the answer engine.
Here are some examples of useful system prompts.
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cited answers">
  ```python
  system_prompt = '''  
  Answer the query based on the following transcripts.
  Also cite where the information was found, displaying the start and end timestamps.
  Make the citation link point to /index/(index_name)/video/(video_id)/gui?start_seconds=(start_seconds)&end_seconds=(end_seconds). 
  
  Return the response in markdown format.
  
  Query: {query}
  Transcripts:
  {transcripts}
'''

  ```
  <Note>Note: The strings `{query}` and `{transcripts}` have to be present in the system prompt.</Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tabular answers">
    ```python
  system_prompt = '''  
  Answer the query based on the following transcripts.
  Display the answer as a markdown table.
  
  Query: {query}
  Transcripts:
  {transcripts}
'''
  ```
  <Note>Note: The strings `{query}` and `{transcripts}` have to be present in the system prompt.</Note>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
  In order to utilize a custom system prompt with the query, do the following:

  ```python
  system_prompt = '''
  Your custom system prompt
  '''
  
  results = client.answer(
              index_name,
              query,
              system_prompt=system_prompt)
  ```

## Next steps

In addition to answering questions, the AskVideos API can also find specific moments in the videos.
