## API key best practices
We recommend the following steps to protect API keys from misuse.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="file" title="Use environment variables">
  Specifying API keys in place can result in unintentional exposure of keys and could make replacement inconveninent.
  ``` bash
  # .env file
  ASKVIDEOS_API_KEY='example_api_key'
  ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="clock" title="Specify a TTL">
  We do not recommend creating API keys that never expire since it can lead to an unncesary increase and potential security vulnerablities.

  To specify a Time-To-Live, navigate to the (API key)[] page and enter a value for when the key should expire.
