## API key best practices
We recommend the following steps to protect API keys from misuse.

  <Accordion icon="file" title="Use environment variables">
  Specifying API keys in place can result in unintentional exposure of keys and could make replacement inconveninent.
  ``` bash
  # .env file
  ASKVIDEOS_API_KEY='example_api_key'
  ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="clock" title="Delete unused keys">
  It is good practice to rotate API keys and delete old keys to prevent unintended usage.
  To do so, navigate to the "API keys" page and click on the trash icon to delete an API key.
