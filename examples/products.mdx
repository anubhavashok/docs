## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an API key">
    First create an API key using the instructions in [API keys](/installation/api-key)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the client">
    Next install the AskVideos client if using [Python](/installation/python). Or consult the [REST API](/api-reference/introduction) reference for other frameworks.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an index">
    Next, [create an index](/quickstart/add-videos#creating-an-index). For this tutorial, we will use an index with the name 'test_index'
  </Step>
</Steps>

In this tutorial, we will index instagram videos from a restaurant and video clips that contain food that is on the menu! We will explore searching via text, images and video. 

## Indexing videos from instagram
```python
index_name = 'instagram_example_index'
channel_name = 'vallatable'
client.index_from_instagram(index_name, channel_name, num_videos=10)
```

## Finding food
A typical social media video for a restaurant includes B-roll of food interspersed with various promotional content including text.

We don't care about those things because we're hungry. We only want the find the parts that have food in them. So for our first query, we'll just search for 'food'.

```python
query = 'food'
results = client.search_videos(index_name, food)
```
<img height="200" src="/examples/images/food.gif" />


## Finding specific food
Now suppose we have a craving for a specific kind of food, let's say some noodles, we can search for that instead.
```python
query = 'noodles'
results = client.search_videos(index_name, food)
```
<img height="200" src="/examples/images/noodles.gif" />

As food names get more specific or complex, the task of identifying food becomes harder. However since the AskVideos API can do image or video queries, we can leverage that instead to identify the food that we want.

In this example, we have a dish called "Pak Mor Cashew". 

Let's see if we can find the right parts of the video given this image.

```python

image_path = '/path/to/pak_mor_cashew.jpg'

results = client.search_by_image(
            index_name,
            image_path=image_path,
            top_k=10)

```

<img height="200" src="/examples/images/pak_mor_result.gif" />

## What we don't want
Sometimes, these videos have text on them or contain footage of people talking. We can remove those by adding a negative query.

This is simple to do with the AskVideos query spec. Simply provide a comma separated list with '-' in front of the negative queries e.g.

```python
# Search for noodles but no people
query = 'noodles,-person'
results = client.search_videos(index_name, food)
```

<img height="200" src="/examples/images/noodles_no_person.gif" />

## Building an app
With these building blocks, we can build a simple but powerful application to tag items in videos!
